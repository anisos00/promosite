                            We wish to create a fracture where time has no hold, in order
                            to reconcile you with human drunkenness as much as with
                            carnal drunkenness. To reinvent the boundaries between the
                            human and the dreamlike. Suspended between two dreams,
                            the community, but also the events between members of our
                            platform and the events of the Golden Indigo distill an artistic,
                            erotic, surreal and wonderful cocktail.

                            For one or several nights within the events of the "Golden
                            Meet", go and meet yourself in unique universes, where a
                            dreamlike and bewitching contrast between sounds, lights,
                            immersive shows, concerts, performances and innovative
                            artists in an atmosphere where time has no hold.

                            We are so connected that we disconnect from reality. What if
                            we told you, that the Golden Indigo offers the opportunity to
                            live new social and spectacular experiences by reconnecting
                            people to each other? What if we told you that you have the
                            power, if you feel like it, to create another pattern: Your
                            pattern.

                        <p>
                            Founded on the idea of a tasty mix between a free community
                            and so-called liberated and sulphurous events, in luxurious
                            settings, the brand advocates a guarantee of quality and is
                            built around its artistic sensitivity and its carefully selected
                            community putting a point of honour on art, carnal beauty, but
                            above all on the personalities of each person, starting with an
                            open-minded population with heterogeneous tastes.
